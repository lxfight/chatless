## ⚠️ Windows Crash on Startup (VC++ runtime required)

On some Windows systems, the app may immediately exit/crash if the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime is missing. Fix it with these steps:

1. Download and install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable (x64):
   - Direct link: <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>
2. After installation, relaunch the app (restart Windows if needed).
3. If the issue persists:
   - Verify “Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable (x64)” is installed under Settings → Apps → Installed apps.
   - Send logs and a brief description via in-app “Settings → Feedback”.

Note: Native dependencies (e.g., Tauri/ONNX) on Windows rely on the MSVC runtime; when missing, startup crashes can occur.

 Thanks to @ukhack for providing this method in https://github.com/kamjin3086/chatless/issues/23#issuecomment-3203662395 .
